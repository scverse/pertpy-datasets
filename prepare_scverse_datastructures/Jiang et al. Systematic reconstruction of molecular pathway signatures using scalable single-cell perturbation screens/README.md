The Seurat objects are available at https://zenodo.org/records/10520190

The objects and corresponding .h5ad files for the Jiang et al. preprint are too large to be concatenated without running out of memory (over 300GB memory usage). Therefore, we can't provide a single .h5ad file for the entire dataset yet. 

The converted .h5ad files are all around 5 to 10 GB in size.
